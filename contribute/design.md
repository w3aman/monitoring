# openEBS Monitoring   

![monitoring](images/monitoring.png)

OpenEBS monitoring written in jsonnet has two components:
1. [**kube-prometheus stack**](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/tree/main/jsonnet/kube-prometheus)  
   It is a monitoring stack which includes prometheus, grafana and alertmanager.  
2. [**openebs-mixin**](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring/tree/develop/jsonnet/openebs-mixin)  
   It is a mixin for openebs. It includes all the dashboards and alert rules for different cas types of openebs which are used to import grafanaDashboards and create prometheusRules objects.
