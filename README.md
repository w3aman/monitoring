[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fopenebs%2Fmonitoring.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fopenebs%2Fmonitoring?ref=badge_shield)

A set of Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alerts for OpenEBS that can be installed as a [helm chart](./deploy/charts/) or imported as [jsonnet mixin](./jsonnet/).

## Status

**Beta**. This repository currently supports dashboards and alerts for `Mayastor`, `LocalPV LVM`, `LocalPV ZFS` OpenEBS storage engines.
This project is under active development and seeking [contributions from the community](#contributing).


## Install

### Using helm

Setup the monitoring helm repository.

```console
helm repo add openebs-monitoring https://openebs.github.io/monitoring/
helm repo update
```

You can then run `helm search repo openebs-monitoring` to see the charts.

Install the helm chart. 
```
helm install openebs-monitoring openebs-monitoring/openebs-monitoring --namespace openebs --create-namespace
```

The detailed chart documentation is available in [charts directory](/deploy/charts/README.md).

### Using kubectl

You can generate YAMLs and install using kubectl. See detailed steps at [./jsonnet](/jsonnet/README.md).

## Usage

### Accessing Grafana

```console
# Look at the Grafana pod and check that the pod is in running state
kubectl get pods -n [NAMESPACE] | grep -i grafana
# Note the public IP of any one of the nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide
# Note the Grafana Service IP
kubectl get svc -n [NAMESPACE] | grep -i grafana
# Open browser and visit http://<NodeIp>:<NodePort> 
#  (where <NodeIp> is the public IP address of your node, and <NodePort> is Grafana Service Port)
#  Default Grafana login credentials- [username: admin, password: admin]
```

**NOTE:** If public IP is not available then you can access it via port-forwarding

```console
# Perform port-forwarding
# kubectl port-forward --namespace [NAMESPACE] pods/[grafana-pod-name] [grafrana-foward-port]:[grafana-cluster-port]
# Open browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:[grafana-forward-port]
# Default Grafana login credentials- [username: admin, password: admin]
```
